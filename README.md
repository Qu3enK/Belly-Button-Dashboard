# Belly Button Dashboard

##Purpose
The purpose of the Belly Button Dashboard is to provide the volunteers of bacterial samples a way to view their results anonymously.  It also provide the volunteer with the top 10 species in their belly button.  In addition, if  Improbable Beef identify a species as a candidate to manufacture synthetic beef, Roza's volunteers will be able to identify whether that species is found in their navel.   [^1]
